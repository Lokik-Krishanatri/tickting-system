My focus was to learn the MERN full web stack. Along the way, I learned many different libraries such as React Routers and Axios.

## Optimizations

One way I optimized the website was by bundling the website for production. By default, the website is in development mode. React includes helpful warnings which is useful for development, but it can make your React app size large. 

## Lessons Learned

Planning and designing are important steps before any implementations.
